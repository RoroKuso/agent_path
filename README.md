# Intro

The main goal of this project is to compare accurate trajectories of pre historic humans
with computed one.

Considering that pre historic humans had to save energy while going from one place to another, we hope our model and approaches are able to take it into account.

##Â 1. Ramanana's model

To compute paths from differents points, Ramanana built a simple model: instead of difficult human with joints and muscles, he uses the "Yoyo man", modeling human walk as a wheel. From there he computes the power needed to walk, from which we can deduce speed and time. He then apply a shortest path algorithm on a map to obtain trajectories and traversal durations.
